         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34255:2"/>and progreſs it had, if GOD in his mercy and goodneſs had not ſet bounds to the ſame, and a tenement entirely built with ſtone and lime had not made interruption. THEREFORE the ſaid Lord Provoſt, Baillies, Council, and Deacons of Craft ordinary and extraordinary, together with the old Magiſtrates and the old Deacons of the ſaid burgh, by theſe preſents, STATUTE AND ORDAIN, That when any houſe or tenement are or ſhall be, at any time hereafter, ruinous or burnt in the roof or uppermoſt ſtoreys thereof, or that a conſiderable part of the ſame ſhall happen to be ruinous or burnt, whether the ſame belong entirely to one heritor or more or diverſe heritors, or when any houſe or tenement ſhall be built from the ground where there was no tenement formerly, within this burgh, <hi>Leith, Canongate,</hi> or ſuburbs, <hi>viz. Weſt-port, Potterrow</hi> or <hi>Pleaſance,</hi> the ſame ſhall be built in ſuch a way as ſhall be moſt fit and ſuitable to the honour of the kingdom, and for the ornament and ſecurity of the City, and of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof, and all others concerned. THAT IS TO SAY, That the front and fore-parts, and other parts of the ſame, ſhall be built altogether with ſtone and lime, and no part thereof, nor any fore-ſtairs of the ſame, ſhall be built with timber: And it is deſired and expected, That the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of ſuch houſes as are built with timber may and will think it their intereſt and ſecurity, that when they think it convenient, and they ſhall have occaſion to repair the ſame, that they be built with ſtone and lime. AND FURTHER, it is ORDAINED AND DECLARED, That hereafter the vennals and cloſſes within the ſaid burgh ſhall not, in any time coming, be obſtructed or ſtraitned with the putting out or building of any fore-ſtairs where was none before the date of thir preſents, ſeeing the ſaid vennals are narrow, and are the King's common ways and paſſages for the uſe of the lieges, and are not to be encroached upon by any fore-ſtair or ſtructure promoted or brought out beyond the buildings upon either ſide; and where there hath been any fore-ſtairs formerly built, it is ORDAINED, for the preventing the hazard of ſire, That where there is any occaſion or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of repairing the ſame, the ſaid fore-ſtairs ſhall be built and repaired with ſtone and lime, at leaſt with plaiſter and tile, in the ſame manner and with the ſame extent as they had formerly, and no further: And in caſe any perſon or perſons ſhall preſume to contravene, or work or build con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the premiſſes, it is DECLARED, That the wrights and craftſmen that ſhall work or build otherwiſe than is above ordained ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed and cenſured, and what ſhall be wrought and built otherwiſe ſhall be demoliſhed and taken down upon the charges of the contravener. AND FURTHER STATUTE AND ORDAIN, That no craftſman of this burgh, in any time coming, ſhall repair or build any houſes or tenements of land within the bounds foreſaid, without firſt they acquaint the Dean of Guild and his Council with the deſign of the ſaid reparation or building, to the end that a viſit may be made upon the ground of the ſaid lands, that the heritors and others concerned may receive a warrant from the Dean of Guild and his Council to repair or rebuild conform to the tenor of this principal act in all points; certifying every maſon, wright, or any other, that does in the contrary, that they ſhall be liable in the penalty of one hundred pound <hi>Scots</hi> money <hi>toties quoties</hi> they contravene thir preſents, by and attour the puniſhment of their perſons, at the diſcretion of the Magiſtrates. And the ſaid Lord Provoſt, Baillies, Council, and Deacons of Crafts, ordinary and extraordinary, together with the old Magiſtrates and Council, by their repreſenting the body and community of the ſaid burgh, and for their particular intereſts, heritors within the ſaid bounds, in ſign and token of their conſent and hearty acquieſcence to this preſent act, have ſubſcribed thir preſents; conſenting to the regiſtration hereof in the books of Council and Seſſion, Town-court or Council-books of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
